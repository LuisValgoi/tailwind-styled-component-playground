# Status

![Vercel](https://vercelbadge.vercel.app/api/luisvalgoi/tailwind-styled-component-playground?style=for-the-badge)

# Stack

- `nextjs` with Incremental Static Regenaration of `10 seconds`.

- `tailwind` for not writing css anymore.

- `tailwind-styled-components` for speedup the development.

# Flow

The idea is to `fetch` the api in the `server` so I can pass to the client the data got from the public [GitHub API](https://api.github.com/users/).

# Scripts

- `yarn dev` to build and run the app.

- just `cp` the `.env.local.example` to a new one called `.env.local`.
